# SGLE-Laser-Research
Some of my graduate research involving models and search algorithms for high energy mode locked laser systems based off of the Sinusoidal Ginzburg Landau Equation. Includes simulation software to model the output of a given set of parameters, a genetic algorithm to seek mode locked extrema, and a toroidal search algorithm to map out the 5+ dimensional dynamics with an adaptive time step to assure convergence.
